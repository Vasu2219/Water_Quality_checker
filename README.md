</div>

## Introduction

Access to clean water is fundamental to human health and wellbeing. However, water quality can be compromised by various pollutants from industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and improper waste disposal. Traditional water quality monitoring methods often involve manual sampling and laboratory analysis, which are time-consuming, costly, and provide only periodic insights. With technological advancements, there is growing interest in developing automated, real-time monitoring systems that can provide continuous data on water quality parameters.

This research introduces a comprehensive framework that leverages IoT sensors, cloud computing, and machine learning to revolutionize water quality monitoring. Our system provides:

* Real-time measurements of critical water quality parameters
* Automated calculation of Water Quality Index (WQI) using both traditional formulas and machine learning models
* Predictive maintenance capabilities for monitoring device components
* A user-friendly web interface for data visualization and analysis

The integration of these technologies enables more efficient, accurate, and accessible water quality monitoring, potentially improving public health outcomes and environmental protection efforts.

## System Architecture

Our system architecture consists of three main components: data acquisition, data processing, and data presentation.

### 2.1 Data Acquisition Layer

The data acquisition layer comprises various sensors that measure key water quality parameters:

* pH sensor for measuring acidity/alkalinity (range: 0-14)
* TDS sensor for measuring dissolved solids (range: 0-2000 mg/L)
* Turbidity sensor for measuring water clarity (range: 0-1000 NTU)

These sensors are connected to a microcontroller that collects readings at regular intervals and transmits the data to the processing layer.

### 2.2 Data Processing Layer

The data processing layer is responsible for:

* Data storage in a SQL database
* WQI calculation using traditional mathematical formulas
* WQI prediction using trained machine learning models
* Device component health monitoring and predictive maintenance

The processing layer is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, with SQLAlchemy for database management.

### 2.3 Data Presentation Layer

The data presentation layer provides a web-based interface for users to:

* View real-time water quality metrics
* Analyze historical trends
* Compare different WQI calculation methods
* Monitor device component health
* Receive alerts for water quality issues or maintenance needs

## Dataset Description

### 3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

Our research utilized a comprehensive dataset of water quality measurements collected from multiple sources:

* Historical water quality records from municipal treatment facilities
* Laboratory analyses of samples collected from various water bodies
* Real-time sensor data from our deployed IoT monitoring stations

The complete dataset consists of 6,500 samples with the following features:

* pH: Measures acidity/alkalinity on a scale of 0-14
* Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Measures dissolved solids in mg/L (range: 0-2000 mg/L)
* Turbidity: Measures water clarity in NTU (range: 0-1000 NTU)
* Temperature: Measures water temperature in degrees Celsius
* Dissolved Oxygen: Measures oxygen content in mg/L
* WQI: Water Quality Index values calculated using standard methods

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing

Before model training, we performed several preprocessing steps:

* Outlier detection and removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize all parameters
* Missing value imputation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach
* Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing) with stratification based on WQI categories

## Water Quality Index Calculation

Water Quality Index (WQI) provides a single value that expresses overall water quality by integrating multiple parameter measurements. Our system employs two methods for WQI calculation:

### 4.1 Traditional Formula Method

The traditional WQI formula calculates a weighted sum of normalized parameter values:

WQI = Σ(wi × qi)

Where:
* wi is the weight assigned to parameter i
* qi is the quality rating of parameter i
* n is the number of parameters

Quality ratings are calculated based on the deviation of each parameter from its standard value:

qi = 100 × |Vi − Videal| / (Vstandard − Videal)

### 4.2 Context-Aware WQI Formula Implementation

Our implementation extends the traditional formula by dynamically adjusting weights based on water conditions. We calculate parameter scores as follows:

pHscore = |pH − 7| × 100 / 7.5
Turbidityscore = |Turbidity| / 5 × 100
TDSscore = |TDS| × 100 / 500

Weight assignments are determined by water type classification:

| Water Type | pH Weight | Turbidity Weight | TDS Weight |
|------------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Highly Alkaline Water (pH > 8.9 or pH < 6) | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.3 |
| High Sediment Water (Turbidity > 15) | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.2 |
| Industrial Waste Affected (TDS > 1000) | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.5 |
| Normal Drinking Water | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.3 |

The final formula-based WQI is calculated as:

WQIformula = (W1 × pHscore) + (W2 × Turbidityscore) + (W3 × TDSscore)

### 4.3 Machine Learning Approach

We developed a machine learning model to predict WQI values based on input parameters. Our model was trained on a dataset of water samples with known parameter values and corresponding WQI values. The model architecture includes:

* Feature selection and normalization
* Regression model training (multiple algorithms tested)
* Hyperparameter optimization
* Cross-validation for model evaluation

### 4.4 ML Model Selection and Evaluation

We evaluated multiple regression models to identify the most effective approach for WQI prediction:

| Model | RMSE | R² |
|-------|------|-----|
| Linear Regression | 7.82 | 0.85 |
| Decision Tree | 6.45 | 0.89 |
| Random Forest | 6.03 | 0.92 |
| Gradient Boosting | 5.72 | 0.94 |
| Support Vector Regression | 6.91 | 0.88 |

Based on these results, we selected the Gradient Boosting Regressor as our final model due to its superior performance (RMSE = 5.72, R² = 0.94).

As shown in Figure 1, the machine learning model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, with predicted values closely matching actual WQI values across the entire range.

## Web Application Implementation

The web application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, with the following components:

### 5.1 Backend Implementation

The backend is responsible for:

* User authentication and session management
* Database operations for storing and retrieving water quality data
* API endpoints for real-time data access
* Integration with the machine learning model for WQI prediction

The implementation includes routes for user registration, login, and a dedicated water quality dashboard.

### 5.2 Frontend Implementation

The frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to:

* View current water quality status via gauges and charts
* Analyze parameter contributions using interactive visualizations
* Compare traditional and machine learning WQI calculations
* Monitor trends and receive alerts
