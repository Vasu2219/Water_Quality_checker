# Water_Quality_checker
1 Introduction 
Access to clean water is fundamental to human health and wellbeing. However, water quality can be 
compromised by various pollutants from industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and improper waste 
disposal. Traditional water quality monitoring methods often involve manual sampling and laboratory 
analysis, which are time-consuming, costly, and provide only periodic insights. With technological ad- 
vancements, there is growing interest in developing automated, real-time monitoring systems that can 
provide continuous data on water quality parameters. 
This research introduces a comprehensive framework that leverages IoT sensors, cloud computing, 
and machine learning to revolutionize water quality monitoring. Our system provides: 
• Real-time measurements of critical water quality parameters 
• Automated calculation of Water Quality Index (WQI) using both traditional formulas and machine 
learning models 
• Predictive maintenance capabilities for monitoring device components 
• A user-friendly web interface for data visualization and analysis 
The integration of these technologies enables more efficient, accurate, and accessible water quality 
monitoring, potentially improving public health outcomes and environmental protection efforts.

2 System Architecture 
Our system architecture consists of three main components: data acquisition, data processing, and data 
presentation. 
2.1 Data Acquisition Layer 
The data acquisition layer comprises various sensors that measure key water quality parameters: 
• pH sensor for measuring acidity/alkalinity (range: 0-14) 
• TDS sensor for measuring dissolved solids (range: 0-2000 mg/L) 
• Turbidity sensor for measuring water clarity (range: 0-1000 NTU) 
These sensors are connected to a microcontroller that collects readings at regular intervals and trans- 
mits the data to the processing layer. 
2.2 Data Processing Layer 
The data processing layer is responsible for: 
• Data storage in a SQL database 
• WQI calculation using traditional mathematical formulas 
• WQI prediction using trained machine learning models 
• Device component health monitoring and predictive maintenance 
The processing layer is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, with SQLAlchemy 
for database management. 
2.3 Data Presentation Layer 
The data presentation layer provides a web-based interface for users to: 
• View real-time water quality metrics 
• Analyze historical trends 
• Compare different WQI calculation methods 
• Monitor device component health 
• Receive alerts for water quality issues or maintenance needs 
3 Dataset Description 
3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing 
Our research utilized a comprehensive dataset of water quality measurements collected from multiple 
sources: 
• Historical water quality records from municipal treatment facilities 
• Laboratory analyses of samples collected from various water bodies 
• Real-time sensor data from our deployed IoT monitoring stations 
The complete dataset consists of 6,500 samples with the following features: 
• pH: Measures acidity/alkalinity on a scale of 0-14 
• Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Measures dissolved solids in mg/L (range: 0-2000 mg/L) 
2 
• Turbidity: Measures water clarity in NTU (range: 0-1000 NTU) 
• Temperature: Measures water temperature in degrees Celsius 
• Dissolved Oxygen: Measures oxygen content in mg/L 
• WQI: Water Quality Index values calculated using standard methods 
3.2 Data Preprocessing 
Before model training, we performed several preprocessing steps: 
• Outlier detection and removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method 
• Feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize all parameters 
• Missing value imputation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach 
• Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing) with stratification based on WQI categories 
4 Water Quality Index Calculation 
Water Quality Index (WQI) provides a single value that expresses overall water quality by integrating 
multiple parameter measurements. Our system employs two methods for WQI calculation: 
4.1 Traditional Formula Method 
The traditional WQI formula calculates a weighted sum of normalized parameter values: 
Σ 
n 
WQI = 
wi × qi 
i=1 
Where: 
• wi is the weight assigned to parameter i 
• qi is the quality rating of parameter i 
• n is the number of parameters 
Quality ratings are calculated based on the deviation of each parameter from its standard value: 
|Vi − Videal|  
qi = 100 × Vstandard − Videal 
4.2 Context-Aware WQI Formula Implementation 
(1) 
(2) 
Our implementation extends the traditional formula by dynamically adjusting weights based on water 
conditions. We calculate parameter scores as follows: 
pHscore = 
|pH − 7| × 100 
7.5 
|Turbidity| 
Turbidityscore = 
TDSscore = 
5 
× 100 
|TDS| × 100 
500 
Weight assignments are determined by water type classification: 
The final formula-based WQI is calculated as: 
WQIformula = (W1 × pHscore) + (W2 × Turbidityscore) + (W3 × TDSscore)

4.3 Machine Learning Approach 
We developed a machine learning model to predict WQI values based on input parameters. Our model 
was trained on a dataset of water samples with known parameter values and corresponding WQI values. 
The model architecture includes: 
• Feature selection and normalization 
• Regression model training (multiple algorithms tested) 
• Hyperparameter optimization 
• Cross-validation for model evaluation 
4.4 ML Model Selection and Evaluation 
We evaluated multiple regression models to identify the most effective approach for WQI prediction: 
Model 
RMSE R² 
Linear Regression 
Decision Tree 
Random Forest 
Gradient Boosting 
Support Vector Regression 
7.82 
6.45 
6.03 
5.72 
6.91 
0.85 
0.89 
0.92 
0.94 
0.88 
Table 3: Performance comparison of regression models for WQI prediction 
Based on these results, we selected the Gradient Boosting Regressor as our final model due to its 
superior performance (RMSE = 5.72, R² = 0.94). 
As shown in Figure 1, the machine learning model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, with 
predicted values closely matching actual WQI values across the entire range. 
5 Web Application Implementation
